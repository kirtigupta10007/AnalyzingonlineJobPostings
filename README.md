# AnalyzingonlineJobPostings

The project seeks to understand the overall demand for labour in the Armenian online job market from the 19,000 job postings from 2004 to 2015 posted on CareerCenter, an Armenian human resource portal. Through text mining on this data, we will be able to understand the nature of the ever-changing job market, as well as the overall demand for labour in the Armenia economy.

Our main business objectives are to understand the dynamics of the labour market of Armenia using the online job portal post as a proxy. A secondary objective is to implement advanced text analytics as a proof of concept to create additional features such as enhanced search function that can add additional value to the users of the job portal.
